## Diablo II Backup Script

This is a simple script for backing up your single player save files

The script creates a new folder named as today's date and time, e.g.
2021-11-10_1906 for 7:06 PM on November 10th, 2021. Then it copies all
the files from your Diablo II save folder into a folder named LoD in the
dated folder, and all the files from your Diablo II Resurrected save
folder into a folder named D2R in the dated folder.

To use, edit the save paths stored in the DIABLO_II, RESURRECTED, and
BACKUP_FOLDER variables to match the full paths to the directories on
your computer. Then simply double click on backup.bat to execute the
script and backup your save files.

You can put the script anywhere you like, and even create a shortcut
for it (e.g. on your Desktop) if you want to.
